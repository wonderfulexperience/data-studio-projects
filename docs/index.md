# Hi, I'm Alexander Trentin

This is my site of projects for the [Lede Program](http://ledeprogram.com)

* [Project 1: Who are the happy people?](https://wonderfulexperience.github.io/happiness/index.html): Using data from the European Social Survey, this project explores the characteristics of people who call themselves "very happy". Beside showing charts regarding different characteristics, it also has an interactive party: readers can also compare themselves to the results in the survey by drilling the data down. The project uses JavaScript libraries such as JQuery and D3.js.
