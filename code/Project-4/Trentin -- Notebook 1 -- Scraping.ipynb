    "The Fed Beige Book is a collection of economic observations and assessments by the Federal Reserve Bank published eight times a year. They provide for each of the twelve districts of the Federal Reserve System and the national level an anecdotal overview of the current economic climate. The different districts provide observations for the whole economy, prices and wages, and individual sectors.<p>\n",
