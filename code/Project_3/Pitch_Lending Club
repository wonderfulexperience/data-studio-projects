What do people need money for?

Lending Club is the largest peer-to-peer lending platform in the world. Since 2010, more than $ 26bn dollars in loans were issued. Borrowers use Lending Club to get cheaper financing than with a bank or to get a loan if the banks do not think they are eligible for it. Reasons for loans can be private or public. The lenders are private investors as well as companies.

Lending Club offers individual data on borrowers. Using this data, I want to have a look who are the characteristics of borrowers.

Questions:
- For what do rich/poor people need to borrow money?
- What kind of profile do people have who are late in paying back their loans?
  (gender, regional, job title, income, reason, state)
- What's a bad thing to borrow money for?


Suggested title:
"Never give money to this type of people"
