\f0\fs24 \cf0 Why are some pension funds so expensive?\
\
The corporate pension funds ("occupational pension plans") in Switzerland manage a huge amount of assets (more than $ 900 bn), which represent a large part of the country's household wealth. It is therefore very relevant how efficient these funds are managed. A survey of large pensions funds show administrative costs varied between $ 160 and 600 per year and insured person. What is the reason that some of these funds are so much more expensive? Are bigger funds more cost-efficient? Or have the more expensive funds better expertise and provide higher returns?\
