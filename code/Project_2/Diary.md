## Diary for the project "Swiss pension funds"

#2017-07-25

Entered the project pitch. Not clear how much I can do with the available data. Unfortunate that the Swiss statistics office doesn't offer individual data on pension funds, only aggregated. Contacted a Swiss asset management company to give more detailed information.

No reply from the asset management company. Using PDF data for costs and returns of pension funds for the last five years from a pension consultant company. Using Tableau to save files from PDF. Using Pandas to combine the data.
